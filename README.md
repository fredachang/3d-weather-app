# 3d-weather-app

This is a city-based weather app created by using Open Weather API and React Three Fibre + Drei. I wanted to make the experience more tactile by implementing a digital window that can be customised by the user in real time. The room objects/plants are designed and modelled in Blender and converted into React components using [GLTFJSX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gltfjsx). Plugging in React Spring and Use Gesture, the user is able to adapt the room layout, saved in local storage, based on individual preferences. Finally, a set of HDR background image is mapped to the weather conditions outputted by Open Weather API, to dynamically change the scene based on weather result.
